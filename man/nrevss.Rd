Description from CDC Flu Portal Dashboard:
Virologic Surveillance â€” Approximately 110 U.S. World Health Organization (WHO)
Collaborating Laboratories and 270 National Respiratory and Enteric Virus 
Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratories, which include both public health 
and clinical laboratories, located throughout the United States participate 
in virologic surveillance for influenza. All public health and clinical 
laboratories report the total number of respiratory specimens tested 
and the number positive for influenza each week to CDC, along with age 
or age group of the person, if available. Beginning in the 2015-16 season, 
reports from public health and clinical laboratories were presented separately 
in the weekly influenza update, FluView. Data from clinical laboratories 
include the weekly total number of specimens tested, the number of positive 
influenza tests, and the percent positive by influenza type. 
Data presented from public health laboratories include the weekly 
total number of specimens tested, the number of positive influenza tests, 
and the number by influenza virus type, influenza A subtype, and 
influenza B lineage. In addition, the age group distribution of 
influenza positive tests are also summarized in Fluview. A subset of 
the influenza viruses collected by public health laboratories are sent to 
CDC for further characterization, including antiviral resistance 
testing and antigenic and/or genetic characterization, and this 
information is presented in the antiviral resistance and 
virus characterization sections of the FluView report.
