Title: An R Package for Estimating Attributable Influenza Morbidity and Mortality
Description: The primary goal of this package is to provide a toolkit for 
researchers who wish to estimate the proportion of a particular outcome 
which is due to influenza. Conceptually this is achieved through estimating 
a baseline rate of the outcome across seasons, then using a measure of 
influenza endemicity to identify the marginal rate due to influenza morbidity. 
The particular measure of influenza endemicity and outcome being modelled 
can be arbitrarily specified by the user.
